      <p>Gungeon 3000 is a spinoff of the critically acclaimed game, Enter the Gungeon. This game is a frenzy filled with bullets, ammunition, monsters. In the game, the player can choose between using different long and short ranged weapons.
        They have to make their way through multiple maps defeating smaller monsters, in order to reach and defeat the final boss. Killing monsters increases your score as well as the possibility of dropping a better weapon. As the player progresses
        through these maps, the difficulty increases. The player can be controlled by the WASD keys and the direction of attack can be chosen by moving the mouse pointer. By left clicking, the player can attack and right clicking gives the player a
        shield for a short amount of time with limited usage.
